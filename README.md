Masking people that are present in an image.

## What is Image Segmentation?
The quality of dataset you choose can either make or break your model. When working with images in artificial intelligence, a mask is made of the image which outlines the shape of the feature being classified in the picture. This step in the computer vision process is called image segmentation and can be the most labor intensive part of data labeling before processing images through a model.
